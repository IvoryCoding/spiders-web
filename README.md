# Spiders-Web
<!-- Project Logo will go here -->
<!-- Project cool buttons such as languages etc. here -->

# Purpose
Spiders web is a Linux and Mac tool that allows you to connect to your servers (i.e. SSH and FTP). Run scripts through connections (i.e. Update servers, read logs, etc.) or scripts on your current device.

The main idea behind my project is to create one place that can manage and connect to your servers. Allowing easier management, response times and incident reporting.

Disclaimer: This is a project being built in my spare time and some functions are not availible or implemented yet. I plan to work on functions that can detect suspicous behaviour on the servers and allow setting rules like kicking connections, banning ips, etc. Which will need a prior ssh connection to be established.
